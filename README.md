# scratch-modules
Many .sprite3 files to put in your scratch project, made by many talented people!

With Scratch Modules, you an extend your scratch project to the next level. Do you hate spending half an hour to make a text system, that doesn't even work at the end? Well we got you covered! We provide a lot of .sprite3 files that you can import directly into your project, that are made to be able to be used on any kind of game, and that all with custom blocks so you dont have to worry about copying code every time you want to use this!

The following files are available at the moment:
blurryknight-switch.sprite3 - Small code to switch a variable from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 with the press of a button. More of a test file then something to actually be used

blurryknight-better-talk.sprite3 - Use this to make your characters talk like in RPGs, while still haing the looks of the scratch talk
